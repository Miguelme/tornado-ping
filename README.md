# Tornado Ping
The general purpose of this project is to illustrate really simple endpoints as ping endpoints using Tornado


## Dependency Management

*Pipenv* is the library used to handle the dependencies as you see we have a pipfile (in _TOML_ format) and a Pipfile.lock to produce deterministic builds


### Installing dependencies
```
$ pipenv install
```

$ pipenv run python main.py
```
